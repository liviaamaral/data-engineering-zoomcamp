# Homework

## Question 1. Redpanda version

Run `rpk version` inside the Redpanda container:

```bash
docker exec -it workshop-redpanda-1 rpk version
```

What version of Redpanda are you running?
**rpk version: v25.3.9**

## Question 2. Sending data to Redpanda

How long did it take to send the data?

- **10 seconds**

## Question 3. Consumer - trip distance

Write a Kafka consumer that reads all messages from the `green-trips` topic
(set `auto_offset_reset='earliest'`).

Count how many trips have a `trip_distance` greater than 5.0 kilometers.

How many trips have `trip_distance` > 5?

- **8506**

## Part 2: PyFlink (Questions 4-6)

## Question 4. Tumbling window - pickup location

Create a Flink job that reads from `green-trips` and uses a 5-minute
tumbling window to count trips per `PULocationID`.

Write the results to a PostgreSQL table with columns:
`window_start`, `PULocationID`, `num_trips`.

After the job processes all data, query the results:

```sql
SELECT PULocationID, num_trips
FROM <your_table>
ORDER BY num_trips DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Which `PULocationID` had the most trips in a single 5-minute window?

- **74**

## Question 5. Session window - longest streak

How many trips were in the longest session?

- **81**


## Question 6. Tumbling window - largest tip

Create a Flink job that uses a 1-hour tumbling window to compute the
total `tip_amount` per hour (across all locations).

Which hour had the highest total tip amount?
